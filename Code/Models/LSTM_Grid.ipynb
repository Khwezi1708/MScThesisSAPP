    "#  Post-Hoc Interpretability with Integrated Gradients (XAI)\n",
    "To understand how the LSTM model arrives at its predictions, we apply post-hoc interpretability methods—techniques used after model training to explain behavior without altering the model itself. One such method is Integrated Gradients, which attributes importance scores to input features based on their contribution to a specific prediction. This approach is particularly valuable for complex, black-box models like LSTMs, where internal mechanisms are not easily interpretable. By applying Integrated Gradients, we gain insights into both individual decisions (local interpretation) and broader model behavior (global interpretation), helping to build transparency, trust, and accountability in the forecasting process.\n"

By attributing importance values to each feature in that one sample, we can understand the direction (positive or negative) and magnitude of their impact on the predicted price. This helps explain the model's reasoning at an individual decision level — for example, highlighting that high 7-day volatility or weekend timing pushed the forecast upward in that particular context."
